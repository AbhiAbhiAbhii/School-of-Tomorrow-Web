The most innovative schools are often exclusively for children from privileged backgrounds. On the other hand, quoting the Radical Departures report from Teach For America's Reinvention Lab, "We cannot define innovation without defining equity. They are inseparable in conversations about education. Innovation solves problems. The most inextricable problem in education is inequity. To be innovative, educational practice must solve for inequity. At the same time, driving harder in the current system and expecting different results has only worked to a point: equity needs innovation to create larger leaps towards a system that works for each and every young person.
