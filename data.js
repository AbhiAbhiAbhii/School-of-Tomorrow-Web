To be innovative, educational practice must solve for inequity. At the same time, driving harder in the current system and expecting different results has only worked to a point: equity needs innovation to create larger leaps towards a system that works for each and every young person. " So, are the two at odds with each other? or can one serve as a natural advantage of the other?`
