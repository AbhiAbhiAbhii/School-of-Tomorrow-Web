      description: `On the one hand, we've seen over and over again, a separation between those innovating in learning in India and those working towards bridging the inequity. The most innovative schools are often exclusively for children from privileged backgrounds. On the other hand, quoting the Radical Departures report from Teach For America's Reinvention Lab, "We cannot define innovation without defining equity. They are inseparable in conversations about education. Innovation solves problems. The most inextricable problem in education is inequity. To be innovative, educational practice must solve for inequity. At the same time, driving harder in the current system and expecting different results has only worked to a point: equity needs innovation to create larger leaps towards a system that works for each and every young person. " So, are the two at odds with each other? or can one serve as a natural advantage of the other?`

      description: `The biggest driver of impact and change is culture. The intangible, magical sauce that ties it all together. It is commonly said that we learn from what people do, not what they say. How we act, what we respond to, what we ignore, what finds time in our meetings, how do we respond to failure and so much more define what is prioritised and built in the school. How do you build a culture that is constantly focused on learning and innovation. How do you weave the focus of building future ready schools into the DNA of your school? What have been key levers in building the same? What are some practices that have had a disproportinate impact on building this culture?`

To effectively influence change at any level, we need knowledge, skills, mindsets and networks. In what ways have you contributed to building your school/community/society/nation? What learning experiences have helped you influence this change? As you think about experiences that shaped your development as a citizen, think about whether these were planned or unplanned, self driven or created by another, in the classroom, school or outside. If you had to design learning experiences that enable us to build the nation, what would you design? What knowledge, skills, mindsets, networks would you design for?`
